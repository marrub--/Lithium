%% \#BEGINNING_Lane_1
During the 17th century of the New Era, our country began drafting the
youth into the military again. Most people couldn't understand why,
even though it was pretty obvious if you looked at our relations with
other nations.
~
I wasn't particularly young, but they decided to draft me anyway -
apparently they were short on people to steal away for their
inscrutable purposes. When my term was up, though, I stayed, unlike
the rest of my motley crew. Sometimes I wish I'd just packed my bags
and left with them, but that thought is always followed with that,
perhaps, this is just where I belong.
~
Where I belong and where I want to be could perhaps be different
places entirely, but as fate has it, I'm going to be in the former, no
matter what. "Oh well," I sigh. "Where in the world are we going?"
~
The scientist responds, "Not *in* the world. Out of it. While your
deploy location is still technically -" I cut him off. "I don't give a
damn. Just tell me where it is."
~
The egghead pauses for a minute. While he doesn't look disturbed by
the question, he seems to not know how to phrase the answer. "Hell.
That's where you're going."

%% \#BEGINNING_Lane_2
Somehow, a scoff escapes me, a disparaging chuckle - I completely
believe him. He deliberates for a moment thinking I'd react harsher,
and asks, "That's it? No questions? That would be quite excellent, as
we haven't much time."
~
"Yeah." I start laughing, quietly. "I'm goin' to Hell."
~
I've heard weirder things. Grandpa Blaze always told me strange
stories of aliens from his dad's childhood, and later finding out they
really do exist, hell. Hell really wouldn't be much stranger, would
it?
~
Can't help it. No use in fighting it. I'll get to shoot demons, I
s'pose.
~
My laughter subsides, and I return my attention to the lab-coated
eccentric. "No complaints here."
~
The scientist looks at me like I've grown a second head and walks back
out the door, writing something on his clipboard all the while.
~
I sit back on the couch and close my eyes, waiting for the next
interview. The sun shines out the window above me, and I fall asleep
for a little while.

%% \#BEGINNING_Jem_1
I try to think to myself for a moment. I look back at the door, then
at the back of this transport ship. I am not allotted time to
consider. I stand up.
~
The robotic voice from earlier calls out, "Destination arrival
completed. Exit the vehicle and proceed with orders." I recall that
this is the thirty seventh time I've heard those words.
~
I'm so tired that I feel like weeping, passing out on the floor of the
transport. I can't, though. The software patcher will halt on any
change in my OS state. Not only will I never be free, but I will
likely die a painful and unforgivable death as my cybernetics fail to
load the proper executables and force me into a state of permanent
entrapment. I must keep going.
~
The information streams through my mind, all the cerebral intake
forcing itself through my consciousness in a raging torrent.
Throughout it I catch the necessary pieces - my orders, and my
thoughts.

%% \#BEGINNING_Jem_2
My mind, though corrupted and unfeeling, still it holds many
treasures: The methods I've learned and the hardware manufactured for
them, the hundreds of hours of mechanical rewiring perfectly
culminating into a vast network of possible configurations - though I
digress.
~
The world is spinning, not just because of my head. Now there is no
way out. So into the midst of Hell I go.

%% \#BEGINNING_Fulk_1
The laboratory is quiet, as always, despite the circumstances.
The silence is only disturbed by the low voices of the staff and the
whirring of computer fans.
~
The deactivated AI stands 18 decimetres tall, as their parts hang
limp. The final adjustments to their mission programming and combat
tuning are under way, only 2 hours to deployment.
~
The team works tirelessly, the mechanics consult the combat veterans
on every small detail, the programmers check every possible code path
for errors. Yet while they worked, still nobody felt certain of the
project.
~
Certainty is simply impossible under these constraints - not only
sending an untested robot into combat, but into combat in a place
built purely of dark energy - the mission was, to put it lightly,
reckless.
~
The existence of Rampancy further bothered the team. The programmers
worked to plug every hole, the engineers made sure every circuit was
perfect and would not malfunction. And still, all of them wondered -
"Would it be enough?"
~
Every major AI before Fulk 5 had gone Rampant - achieved a state of
true sentience, though also one of pure untethered nihilism. The
possible causes were many, perhaps infinite, and so still none have
prevented it. Popular theory among AI researchers suggests it may
simply be impossible.

%% \#BEGINNING_Fulk_2
Isolation from the network is a blessing with such a system. Fulk has
been built to work alone, no monitoring, no connections. The concern
arose from the question of whether or not the mission would be
completed.
~
Corruption by outside forces would prove disastrous. While an issue,
there are no other options; KSKK must fight to keep their world from
destruction.

## ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╕
%% \#BEGINNING_Luke_1
Lucas feels a disturbance. The same kind of disturbance it felt 300
years ago. Unlike that time, it could pinpoint it - the definite
location of the invasion. It was certain that this time, not going
would be a fatal mistake.
~
The lone Kiryy quickly gathered its things. A circle of light absorbed
its belongings, and its revolver, and it quickly left its small desert
hut, searching for transportation.
~
The disturbance was quite a few parsecs away, but still felt right
next to it. While it could discern it to be an invasion, it was not
sure of what or when, or indeed why. Lucas was not most interested in
thinking of these things. It preferred to rely on its instincts alone.
~
The transport station was nearby, but it was not in the best of shape.
There was a government station few miles further, but it always chose
the closer one - this one - because it liked the shopkeeper. She
didn't judge by appearances.
~
It rented a vehicle and set off for distant stars, hoping to find the
answers and knowledge it had pursued for so long.

## ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╕
%% \#BEGINNING_Omi_1
"What do you mean, I shouldn't go for it?" the girl asks, irritated by
his answer. "It's simply too dangerous to use, let alone get your
hands on. We can't start an insurrection just to go somewhere new. To
a new universe, trying to find, what, Score?"
~
"Ari, you know I can handle myself wherever I go!" she retorts. His
answer is unchanged - "No. Omi, we can't. If you-"
~
Omi's face darkens. She knows that what she's doing is reckless, yet
her lust for new adventures won't let her take grip of the situation.
Or, perhaps it's just a material lust. At this point, not even she can
tell for sure.
~
The greed overtakes her, and turns into anger; like a tiger breaking
out of a cage in her mind. Her hand moves to her sheath, and -
~
The flash of electricity stuns her brother Aricil - completely
incapacitated by her immense flurry of strikes. By the time he comes
to, she's already gone like the wind.
~
In another world, the Assassin awakens. Her head hurts. Everything
around her moves in slow motion. Not just for a moment, but
continually. Wherever she's landed, time is simply different.

%% \#BEGINNING_Omi_2
This amuses her. She begins to laugh. The world's strongest killer,
now with the world's fastest reflexes. Nothing will stop her now.
~
And then, she notices her surroundings. A wide field between
mountains, with a road to her right. In the distance a city, but
nearby, nothing but grass. Her shoulders slump and again her
expression darkens.
~
Rain spatters down, and quickly gets heavy as she sits in the field.
The rain is not water, but metal – and the sky is far darker than it
should be.
~
Without a soul in sight, she looks up. The world is being devoured by
a black hole.
~
The Assassin prays for safety.

## ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╕
%% \#BEGINNING_Ari_1
Her face darkens. Aricil can tell that she will strike him, and that
there's no escape from her attack. He braces for the blow, despite the
futility of doing so.
~
The flash of electricity stuns him - completely incapacitated by her
immense flurry of strikes. By the time he comes to, she's already gone
like the wind.
~
Without a word, he gets up. His body sustained the damage superbly,
though his sensibilities are still sorely hurt by her actions. His
sister has vanished to a location unknown to all the world, a place
possibly unconnected to even the concept of time.
~
Aricil retrieves his swords and pistol. Two blades, one fused with a
fantastic Indicolite. A pistol of .750 caliber. Omisielle thinks she
can handle herself, but he could survive twelve kilo-megaton nuclear
detonations and still fight.

%% \#BEGINNING_Ari_2
The armor-bound warrior battles through the capitol of his home town.
The occupational government was instituted 5 years ago now, a relic of
the war with the moon civilization 20 years ago.
~
He enters the chamber of the Dimension Driver, and within moments, a
titanic flash casts him into another plane.
~
In another world, the Dark Lord awakens. His head hurts. Everything
around them moves in slow motion. Not just for a moment, but forever.
Time flows differently here, he supposes. At least it's here at all.
~
Inspecting his surroundings, he has awoken in a dark place, almost
suiting him. Yet, a darker energy emanates throughout the atmosphere
of this place, more sinister than should be possible.
~
The Dark Lord prays for safety.

%% \#BEGINNING_Kiri_1
... Time does not exist in this place.
~
For this reason I believe I have been reincarnated. Because I think, I
am - and I have been summoned to divide the...
~
The... There's a problem; but the nature of it is indiscernible. While
the knowledge of all my past lives and predictions of the future stay
true, the self is false. It has been falsified. Not by me, or by "me."
~
While I ponder this discrepancy it dawns on "me." The self of now does
not impact the past, but merely the future. And so, it shall have been
that it was merely the needs of causality asking that I ... change.
~
Well, my ways have always been given doubt by those around me. Perhaps
it's time for a change. Something more... imbalanced.
~
While not a God, still some properties of them seem to rub off on me.
I am affected by the waves, I sleep in nothingness. I am absolute.
Yet, what I am still missing is faith.
~
I may wish for more than this immortality, but I shall not act out of
my being just to get there. Having no faith is better than what I
would become. Being more than grey would be worse than staying between
the folds.
