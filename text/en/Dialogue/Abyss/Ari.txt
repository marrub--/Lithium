Do you aspire to be just one? One thing, one person? Is, in the
multiplicious soup, the melange of life, your stated goal to avoid
it? Do you aspire to be another person? To live their life, see
through their eyes, see into what they are? Was that what you always
were?

PERSONHOOD: Defined by a clinging of one's self—rather, one's
consciousness—to this mortal world. Well, okay, we might not be in a
mortal world at the moment. But let's keep going.

If I am you, and you are me, then, well, who am I? We look the same,
we talk similarly. But, you don't know what I'm going to say. Are we
really the same person, then? If we had no hidden variables—say, if a
divine being were to look at us—what would we see?

A mirror?

Someone completely different on each end?

Now, why do I look like a doll to you?

I think of myself that way?

I don't know. Maybe you knocked your head on the way into Hell? Does

No.

OK, I guess.

@@ \#dlg_abyss_d_whym_1
It was a dark and stormy night. You were on your way into Hell,
following your sister. If we remember how black holes work, they're a
compact mass deforming spacetime. In this case, it was a maliciously,
intentionally placed piece of exotic matter. You got sucked out of
your normal place in the abelian group—er, sorry, rather, you're past
and simultaneously in the event horizon, and right now, you're
experiencing a state of consciousness that's not normally possible,
because it's a weird and fucked up kind of spacetime here. Okay?

@@ \#dlg_abyss_d_selse_0
Interesting choice, what with the other one seeming more correct; but,
you're actually still not far off. If your consciousness was like a
large collection of photons, it's not just reflecting like a mirror
now, but bouncing off a wall, and on the opposite side of the wall,
where no light is shining, is you.

Next, let's get into a deeper, more philosophical question: Why do I
look like a doll to you?

%% \#dlg_abyss_d_selse_o0
Well, by that description, I suppose it's what my mind's eye sees?

%% \#dlg_abyss_d_selse_o1
Do I really see myself that way?

I don't know.

Yes. I suppose. I guess. Yes! Obviously! Jackass! Why does your mind's
eye see \cna doll\c-?

Is the question somehow unintuitive? No, I see. You're deep into

Try to hold yourself together. If you're feeling intimidated,
perhaps this part of me is just scary. You see a mirror of hurt, it
hurts you.

@@ \#dlg_abyss_d_holdys_1
No, try to hold yourself together. Death isn't even an option in this
interstice. You'll get out alive. You can think about dying after
that.

@@ \#dlg_abyss_d_holdys_2
Now: You are a doll. I am a doll. We both are seeing the same thing.
We are the same person, but both of us see something wrong. You need
to calm down. You need to stop feeling the need to throw yourself
away. You need to calm down. You need to see yourself as human.

%% \#dlg_abyss_d_holdys_o0
How?

@@ \#dlg_abyss_d_doll_0
Right. And when I look at you, I see you as a doll, too.

But, is this the right metaphor? Now that we've deduced this, it all
seems kind of straight-forward. Dolls represent something kept and
maintained, but less than human, able to be thrown away by the less
sentimental. If you see yourself as a doll, you're seeing yourself as
something less than human. If you're afraid of being thrown
away—obviously, I know you are—please stop willingly throwing yourself
away.

%% \#dlg_abyss_d_doll_o0
You don't have the right to tell me this.

Alright. Why am I telling myself this?

@@ \#dlg_abyss_d_hallow_0
This hallowed place splits thought and matter like nothing else. This
mirror of you—and the wall that separates us—makes it hard to answer
that question. We could talk for hours, or you could just leave.

@@ \#dlg_abyss_d_hallow_1
I'm sorry that I've strung you along like this. Just try to relax, and
leave when you feel comfortable.

better.
