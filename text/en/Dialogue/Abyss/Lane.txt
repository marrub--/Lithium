Hmm... Well, whatever. Say, do you like RPG games? Also, where exactly

me this hard to follow.]

Don't you hate it when they make you grind to get a 100% run? It's
just kind of mean to do that. Why not just make hidden areas?

recently, and I did end up thinking that. Weird.]

operation was canceled a month ago. Blazkowicz, their point man,
refused the mission.]
