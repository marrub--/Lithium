\cdI'm sure there's quite a bit of shellshock going on right now.
Apologies. I'll try to talk in terms you might understand a little
better.

\cdI know that you don't know me. But I've known you for several
hundred years. Something changed in you suddenly and you forgot
everything. As I was beginning to worry I noticed something peculiar.

\cgEvery atom in your body \cdhad been mutated in some way. Some of
them simply moved, others changed structure, and some of them even
were removed completely. I don't think I have to tell you how odd it
is for something to simply vanish from the universe. I'm not even sure
it's possible.

\cdAll that can wait for a moment. I'll get back to you with my
findings and some explanations to get you up to speed, after we've
resolved our current dilemma.

\cdThe armory is currently under lock-down due to the invading forces.
There is an \cnoverride KeyDisk\cd available, but it is itself
currently locked in storage.

\cdNot to worry, though. There is a nearby access point that can
request the disk be... \cnrelocated\cd. One of the gateways opened by
the intruders can be used for this, but unfortunately in doing so you
will also have to temporarily open it to them as well.

\cdOnce you have the \cnoverride disk\cd and have made your way inside
the armory proper, acquire one of the weapons there and \cfI will
relocate you from this terminal\cd.

\cdYou should go through the ventilation access to get to there. I'll
unlock it for you now.

\cgThe armory \ch(?\crhas been\ch|\cris\ch)\cg set into lock down. You
must go to the access point and \cnrelocate the override KeyDisk\cg.
Unfortunately the method of transport is not as easy.

\cgRelocation requires the use of the enemy's gateways. You will also
let them in temporarily by doing so. Be prepared for a fight.

\cgI apologize for my bluntness. Hopefully these
\ch(?\crsmall\ch|\crmeasly\ch)\cg weapons will be adequate for your
mission. I apologize for the distress.

\cgI will open the ventilation access doors now.

I'm Maxie. I used to be the 4334th Counsel of the 51st Era Judgment.
Now I'm, uh, this. Sorry to disappoint.

I was the 4334th Counsel of the 51st Era Judgment. Now I'm, as you can
quite clearly see, a bowl, an eye, and a power core.

== \#OPT_M1A2_01_02_01 | That's quite sad. Can you explain that to me?
== \#OPT_M1A2_01_02_02 | What a shame.

@@ \#DLOG_M1A2_01_03
Explain? Well, you surely know the Judgment. I can only presume you
mean how I got in this state.

In the beginning of the 51st Era I was cast out of Judgment and forced
into a body. I decided it would be best for me to roam this galaxy to
see if I could find a place to hide. However, marauders found me along
my journey, and now most of my body is gone. All that remains are my
power core and this eye.

== \#OPT_M1A2_01_03_01 | Cool. Thanks for the story.
== \#OPT_M1A2_01_03_02 | I'm not really interested anymore.

@@ \#DLOG_M1A2_01_04
If you wish to hear more stories, I'll be around. I can still move in
this form, somewhat. At a snail's pace. It's better than nothing, I
suppose.

Maybe if I put wheels on this bowl I'd go faster...
