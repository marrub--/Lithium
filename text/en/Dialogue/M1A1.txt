\cdApologies for the abrupt stop, this ship hasn't run the faster than
light engine enough times. We didn't collide with the planet, so I'm
not very worried about its future performance, now.

\cdWe have arrived at \cnNisiv 16\cd; the \cforange\cd planet, if you
look out the window, is \cnNanto\cd. Your objective is somewhere
there.

\cdUnfortunately, that will have to wait. The ship has been boarded by
demons. The assailants appear to be scouts for a bigger plan, so as to
say, they're going to come back and kill us now that they know the
ship's layout.

\cdSo, before we go on to your mission on \cnNanto\cd, I need you to
transfer me onto a backup device. I'll plan an escape for you as soon
as I can, but this ship is going to go down along with those options.
It'll take some time.

\cdWhile you do that, I'll be showing the demons to my \cnbeautiful\cd
defense system. Thank you, by the way, for cleaning out the turrets.
Wonderful machines, those.

\cgThe planet \cnNanto\cg is now directly right of us. The faster than
light engine worked better than \ch(\crI\ch)\cg expected, and a
landing should be possible soon.

\cnNisiv 16\cg appears to be full of \ch(?\cractive demonic
energy\ch|\crdemonic presence\ch)\cg. This is a problem for me.

\cgThose \crdemons\cg decided this ship is of great value to them, and
have boarded \ch(\crforcefully\ch)\cg. Having tapped into their weaker
communications, I have found that they \ch(\crplan\ch|\crhave

\cgI need you to transfer me onto a backup device before we land on
\cnNanto\cg. The automated defense systems will help you, but you are
mainly on your own here. Good luck.
