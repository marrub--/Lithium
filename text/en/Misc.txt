@@ \#OPENER
1626, New Era.

A revelation in multiverse theory: Proof of other, unseen universes
existing within the same dimension of time as our own.

Finally explaining the odd artifacts which had been found throughout
the New Era, the researchers involved were to be awarded for their
incredible discovery, but soon after, their entire institute
disappeared.

Twenty years later: 1649 NE

After an arduous investigative scan, hardware mega-corporation Optic
Fiber Maxim-Danil discovers the missing research facility in uncharted
space and opens a communications link.

On the other end of the line, the only thing visible was a bloody red
pulp floating in open space. The system's star soon collapsed into a
black hole, sucking all matter into it and emitting a new, dark
energy.
