@@ \#INFO_DESCR_Mateba
A re-creation of the classic Mateba Model 6 Unica revolver, which was
popular in the middle of the second age thanks to its unique design
and style.

This version is suited for a left-handed user, with a barrel that
opens to the right. The weapon takes .454 Casull, with half of the
rounds in a cylinder and the other half in a magazine in the grip. The
weapon fires every other round out of the magazine through the
ejection port, and the rest are kept in the cylinder.

Due to the original design being lost to time, this revolver sports
several accuracy issues, but nonetheless has retained the classic look
and feel of the original gun. This particular model was produced by
A.O.F Inc. for knight-class units.

artifact; the weapon then takes this hyper-condensed energy and emits
it into a very small, circular disc buffer on the top of the weapon.
