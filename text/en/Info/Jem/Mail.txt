Notes:

40 thousand lines dumped so far, maybe 30-40% done? Estimated total ~200k SLoC
ROM is about half C source, quarter XMb5 using SKVM, the rest is scripts
@@
Important bits already dumped, the custom lock remover does not skimp
on anything

Next goal while this continues decompiling is to find all active AOF
hostnames and block them, the main servers are already deactivated but
there might be more. Rerouting to other active companies' addresses
has helped clear my mind.

It's all gone now. My mind is at ease. Though now I wonder what the
other deceivers must have gone through.

The core of hell is still far yonder, but yet my body trembles in its
sheer horror... Maybe I'll make it out alive if I'm lucky, but I
should at least try.

The kernel and ROM etc. sources are all done dumping, the utilities
are still going but those aren't important and have already been
scanned for ASIC code.

Proc. analysis has been done on all of the dumped code, revealing many
unoptimized code paths, ASIC crap, and a few red herrings. Not careful
enough for technology that could easily exist two years after this was
developed.

I've entered a strange realm that doesn't seem to make sense. This
must really be Hell itself; no mistaking it now.

The air is so humid and hot that I've begun sweating. That can't
happen. I can't sweat. There isn't anything to sweat. I'm scared. This
has to be an illusion... or does truth really not matter in this
place?

In any case, now that I'm here, there's no turning back. I have to
destroy whatever corrupted them, I'm sure they're here... I saw it in
their eyes, they were yelling at me visions of their true selves that
could not be described with human eyes. That only I could know.

Though I had just regained my grasp of it, now reality itself may lie
out of my hands.

It doesn't matter. I will see this through.
