\ccI woke in a \cudark place\cc, unsure of my fate; if my life was
renewed out of cruel retribution or of a final opportunity.

\ccI wandered this hell, more real and yet more dream-like than I
thought possible, seeking any sign of escape; any sign of pity from
the monsters that inhabit this place.

\ccNo, the fate of the damned is but this.

\ccI can only guess that my family went to Heaven and that I was left
the lone sinner.

\cgThank you for putting this to an end.

There aren't many like you who can take such a being down. Maybe I
should commend you for that, struggler.

No, there is no need. What your victories have done is enough.

\cgMaybe I advise you turn back.

\crI am not the strongest of these manifestations.

Maybe you don't need such advice.

\caOne shan't care what he shoots, but one may take care in where he treads.

\ca     And I think that you've treaded
\cr   a bit too far.

\ca Perhaps just me.
\ca    Or maybe you agree?

\ca            Here is a gift.

\ca  I won't tell you to use it wisely.
