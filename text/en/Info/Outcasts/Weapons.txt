@@ \#INFO_DESCR_MissileLauncher
Have you ever wanted a weapon that fires over 2,000 missiles a minute?
Don't lie to me, I know you have. This weapon delivers.

The miniature missiles the X-400 launches are medium-yield, they won't
hit as hard as regular fare, but they will pack quite a punch with the
rate you can put them out.

Has an internal revolving chamber that holds 30 rockets, fired in
trios as the cylinder revolves. New ammunition can be loaded by
shoving it carefully into the underside of the gun, similar to a
shotgun, thanks to a convenient automatic rotation as it detects newly
loaded missiles.
