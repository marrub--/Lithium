- MONSTERS

Lithium comes with a set of new behaviours for monsters, with the
option of more difficult behaviour. Several monster mods also work
with Lithium; however, if enemies don't show on the vital scanner as
having a level, they aren't compatible.

! Please report broken monster mods.

- PHANTOMS

\c[Lith_Dark]Phantoms\c- will show up occasionally based on your
progression. They are very dangerous mid-bosses that give
class-specific <permanent upgrades>.

- BOSSES

<Boss levels> are given unique behaviour. The <Icon of Sin> has
entirely new behaviour.

- LEVELS

All enemies have a <level> and <rank>. Enemies with higher <levels>
will have more health, deal more damage, and resist damage better.
Enemies with higher <ranks> will have higher level scaling, more
resistances, and gain experience faster.

- DAMAGE TYPES

There are 8 damage types enemies can inflict:
\c[Lith_Bullet]Bullet\c-, \c[Lith_Energy]Electric\c-, \cxFire\c-,
\crFire Magic\c-, \czIce\c-, \ctMagic\c-, \csMelee\c-, and
\c[Lith_Rocket]Shrapnel\c-.
