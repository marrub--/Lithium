Project 114 is the current military operation you are enacting.
Started by a contract between OFMD, KSKK and your country's military,
Project 114 aims to destroy the dimension known as Hell, which is
currently invading our own.

As of writing, only 3 of the 8 operatives sent in remain. Two robots,
and yourself. You are to act as the point man and only main force
against the threat. Failing that, you are to help open a pathway to
the core of Hell for other operatives to complete the mission with.

Your advisor is Adam Lambert, and 11 generals currently oversee all of
your actions on the field.

@@ \#INFO_DESCR_OPD2
After seven years of planning, Operation Deception 2 has finally gone
underway. Along with Michael, Zeke, Solomon, and three others, we are
finally setting ourselves free.

I wasn't expecting Solomon of all people, part of Order, to be the one
to mastermind this, but here we are, years later, finally doing it.

Not to be pessimistic, but I don't think any of us will survive this.
It's just statistically impossible. Even I may die. There are
assassins after us, and now we're in Hell itself.

I'll need a Theophylline supplement after this is over.

@@ \#INFO_DESCR_HackInfo
Welcome to Zeke's Custom Lock Remover, version 1.0. Well, there won't
be any other versions anyway, but here we are. If you're reading this,
that means it worked, and the kernel has been successfully jailbroken.
I couldn't brief you on this beforehand, but now that we have some
privacy, here's what this thing can do:

So, running our own code is too risky, as you know. The ASIC would
catch it right away. But what we can do is get the kernel to execute
code for us, specifically when it's already in ring 0. Well, you may
have noticed Solomon's name in the mission parameters looked a bit
off. Since he was the instructor, we set his name to overflow a
certain buffer during a kernel call, straight into a function pointer.
Just point that right next to the fixed address, and bam. Kiloword
boundaries give us plenty of space to write a self-modifying program
in that padding space.

This also included some other vital parts besides the lock remover and
the decompiler, mainly the graphics for your weapon materializers.
(Sorry they don't look so great, the raw optic nerve image format is
rather large.) The generational program will within a few minutes give
you a working decompiler and within half an hour it'll be ready to
start going at the ROM sources. From there it'll embed itself into the
ROM and your mind will have fully returned to you by the end of the
day.

Now, what it can't do: Get rid of the ASIC chip. You will have to be
careful not to trip it, but for the most part, it just doesn't have
permissions to track anything we're doing. You should be able to
mitigate it in a few ways since this program removes all of the hooks
in the kernel that call into it, but you'll have to do them yourself.
I'm sure you can. Good luck. Zeke.

The Biotic Information Panel, or B.I.P. (sometimes "BIP,") is a
program written in portable C150 which gathers information from local
area networks on various subjects. When it is triggered to look up a
subject, it also looks for relevant information either related to or
mentioned by the subject.

The program is extremely popular because of its simple, yet useful,
function. It is distributed freely by the Software Sans Pretium
Foundation, and the software is included in most C/B operating system
bases.

The latest version of the software is 2.5, and since version 2.0 it
