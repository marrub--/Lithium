Project 114 is the current military operation you are enacting. Started by a
pact between OFMD, KSKK and your country's military, Project 114 aims to
destroy the dimension known as Hell, which is currently invading our own.

As of writing, only 3 of the 8 operatives sent in remain. Two robots, and
yourself. You are to act as the point man and only main force against the
threat. Failing that, you are to help open a pathway to the core of Hell for
other operatives to complete the mission with.

Your advisor is Adam Lambert, and 11 generals currently oversee his and your
actions on the field.

@@ \#INFO_DESCR_OPD2
After seven years of planning, Operation Deception 2 has finally gone underway.
Along with Michael, Zeke, Solomon, and three others, we are finally setting
ourselves free.

I wasn't expecting Solomon of all people, part of Order, to be the one to
mastermind this, but here we are, years later, finally doing it.

Not to be pessimistic, but I don't think any of us will survive this. It's just
statistically impossible. Even I may die. There are assassins after us and now
we're in Hell itself.

I'll need a Theophylline supplement after this is over.

@@ \#INFO_DESCR_HackInfo
Welcome to Zeke's Custom Lock Remover, version 1.0. Well, there won't be any
other versions anyway, but here we are. If you're reading this, that means it
worked, and the kernel has been successfully jailbroken. I couldn't brief you
on this beforehand, but now that we have some privacy, here's what this thing
can do:

So, running our own code is too risky, as you know. The ASIC would catch it
right away. But what we can do is get the kernel to execute code for us,
specifically when it's already in ring 0. Well, you may have noticed Solomon's
name in the mission parameters looked a bit off. Since he was the instructor,
we set his name to overflow a certain buffer during a kernel call, overflowing
straight into a function pointer. Just point that right next to the fixed
address, and bam. Kiloword boundaries give us plenty of space to write a
self-modifying program in that padding space.

This also included some other vital parts besides the lock remover and the
decompiler, mainly the graphics for your weapon materializers. (Sorry they
don't look so great, the raw optic nerve image format is rather large.) The
generational program will within a few minutes give you a working decompiler
and within half an hour it'll be ready to start going at the ROM sources. From
there it'll embed itself into the ROM and your mind will have fully returned
to you by the end of the day.

Now, what it can't do: Get rid of the ASIC chip. You will have to be careful
not to trip it, but for the most part, it just doesn't have permissions to
track anything we're doing. You should be able to mitigate it in a few ways
since this program removes all of the hooks in the kernel that call into it,
but you'll have to do them yourself. I'm sure you can. Good luck. Zeke.

The Biotic Information Panel, or B.I.P. (sometimes "BIP,") is a program written
in portable C150 which gathers information from local area networks on various
subjects. When it is triggered to look up a subject, it also looks for relevant
information either related to or mentioned by the subject.

The program is extremely popular because of its simple, yet useful, function.
It is distributed freely by the Software Sans Pretium Foundation, and the
software is included in most C/B operating system bases.

The latest version of the software is 2.5, and since version 2.0 it has had
automatic update functionality.
