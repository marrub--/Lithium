diameter nanomachine-built centerfire bullets for long-range accuracy.

@@ \#INFO_DESCR_ShrapnelGun
A reverse-flow vacuum used to displace heavy metals in the
zero-gravity production of spacecraft. Seemingly effective as a gun
when overloaded. Normally, this weapon wouldn't work well without an
atmosphere, but the exceptional space of Hell appears to allow some
pressure differential to still exist. This model was designed by Sewek
Heavy Industries for Qasl.

A double-barreled shotgun utilizing heavy black powder cartridges.
Shells are loaded with four bismuth balls of buckshot. The only
notable thing about this weapon is its overwhelming power. It's been
used to kill dozens of dangerous animals, maybe, cruelly, some other
humans, and now demons. Use it to defend yourself.

Directly translates to "11 squared." Of unclear manufacture and
origin. It may be a replica of the first gun ever made: It clearly
exhibits late Spacewar/early Great Death design philosophy and
manufacturing principles, but carbon dating and replicator errata
place this particular gun in a much later period.

Weapons made for you by Omisielle. Two ground-to-ground rocket
launchers designed to be used in tandem. Sophia fires homing shots,
while Franca fires normal rockets. One known design flaw is that the
scopes are non-functional, as they only have tinted glass inserted as
a placeholder. These weapons were only used for one battle during the
start of the Second Death period, being discontinued as soon as the
fight moved from the Moon to Earth.

long as the power is on, this weapon continues to emit deadly sparks
out the front. The weapon must be installed into the user's shoulder
and back muscles via cybernetics to interface with their aura. Once
installed, it will cause no harm to its user.

Utilizes indigo-purple chromagic. Unknown inner workings.

The 339-7 REMS is a heavy machinegun that was developed during the
last few years of the Dewar period by Qasl for their 339-7 spacecraft.
Utilizing small chains of volatile lithium microcules, the gun has
incredible ammo efficiency, being able to essentially fire forever.
When not attached to a ship, the reserves are far lower and it can
only be used for short amounts of time, but it still generates
thousands of projectiles with only 150ml of total ammunition.

Utilizes blue and purple-red chromagic for microcule compression and
decompression.
