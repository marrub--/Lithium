Extreme caution is advised against these enemies, and if you can run
from them, they will only ever continue to chase you down.

Rumors have spread that these beings speak to those who come near
them. Setting aside the obviously dangerous nature of this rumor,
there have been an increasing amount of people reporting things said.
Collating their stories, the common pattern seems to be that they talk
about stories of the past. Similarities between the phantoms and
particular heroes of old appear in a vast majority of these reports.
