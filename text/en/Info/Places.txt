@@ \#INFO_DESCR_AetosVi
A planetary system 17 lightyears away from Earth that houses several planets
with sentient life on them. Found approximately 700 years ago now, this is the
second system reached by humans, and the first with sentient life.

When the system was found, rejoice was had throughout all mankind, finally
knowing that they weren't alone in the universe.

Then, of course, the expeditioners were attacked by natives.
But that's fine details.

@@ \#INFO_DESCR_Algidistari
Algidistari is a planetary system 45 lightyears in distance from Earth. While
it has many planets in its main sequence, and many rocks, it is for the most
part not suitable for human life due to its cold atmosphere caused by a small
central star.

Several of the planets in this system such as Neptune 11 are quite large and
are semi-habitable, thus becoming quite suitable for magi of the
\chCaeruleum\c- mode to test magic on.

A planet in the Aetos-Vi planetary system composed of four land masses and a
large amount of water, populated by a highly intelligent light-manipulating
race known as the Kiri.

Previously, humans also lived on this planet, but were driven out by a large
scale terrorist enactment.

Ch'ari is generally dull and dark-grey looking save for the water, but the
communications of the Kiri light up the darkness in a beautiful fashion.

Its inhabitants include fish and plant life, as well as land-dwelling beasts
such as giant mammoth-like creatures and the two-legged Falx.

A planet in the Aetos-Vi planetary system whose dominant species is a humanoid
avian creature, the "Peristera" or, colloquially, "Perist".

When humans arrived on Durla Prime, the Peristeras were highly frightened by
the presence of an alien, sentient being, and war broke loose. Refusing to
attack, the humans ended the war a mere month later, after learning to
communicate with the avian species.

The planet is extremely similar to Earth, even having grass and trees that
mostly resemble their earthly counterparts.

The year is 1649 New Era. After an event that almost led to an apocalypse in
3031 CE, humanity collectively decided to mark a new era dedicated to
progressing travel and communications across the galaxy.

Earth has stayed largely the same as it was in the Common Era, thanks to
advances in science.

By 1000 NE, most of the population on Earth had moved to other inhabitable
planets, but still a large population remains on the blue planet.

Whether the Hell found ripping into our dimension is actually from any known
religion is not known. What is known, however, is that its inhabitants seek to
destroy and enslave everything they can get their hands on.

Composed of several ranks, Hell is a dictatorship led by one called the Icon
of Sin, or Satan by some. The inhabitants of Hell seem to gain some kind of
energy from suffering and death, possibly an abstract power like that
previously found on Earth, thousands of years ago.

In 2714 CE, a huge interplanetary workload boom began, spawning numerous
factories and artificial workplaces on Mars manned by robots.

Thanks to advances in terrestrial travel, the ability to transfer goods
between Mars and Earth became cheap enough to be profitable during the periods
where Mars is closer to Earth.

Still to this day many companies on Earth -- and even some intra-galactic
corporations like OFMD -- use Mars as a place to house autonomous work.

A strange dimension. The beings of the God Cage are the most powerful beings in
all of existence, capable of destroying reality itself if they thought it best.

The God Cage itself is a finite dimension, possibly the first of any. While it
cannot be visually described, it is known that all particles in this dimension
are made of pure, primordial magic of which is untouchable by any outside
source; hence the name, a caged dimension for only the Gods to roam.

Hermes is the only known God capable of holding a physical form outside of the
God Cage, and moreover the only one capable of outside communication.
His demise during the events of the calamity have halted all further knowledge
about the dimension, leaving it merely the mental shape of a huge chrome
cylinder box.

Most things about this hyperdimension are unknown as of yet. When the God Thoth
descended to the mortal realm in 1344 NE, the body she chose told stories of
living in this dimension before becoming an immortal holy vessel.

Before this event, the dimension was unheard of, with no leaps occurring
between it and this realm. Since Thoth left this place, nothing more has been
found, leading to lots of speculation and questioning of whether this place
truly exists. Nevertheless, many years later, artifacts began to surface.

The origin of its name is unknown, and many details of its appearance were
left vague by the legendary vessel, making consensus difficult on its
description.

A system about 45 lightyears from Earth, not far from Algidistari. The system
is composed of 14 planets and one star, which emits slightly more heat than
the Sun, making the planets here extremely temperate during solar cycles.

Three of the planets, Eta, Ni and Keta, are desert planets capable of
inhabiting human life, although have few native inhabitants, none sentient.
Seven of the planets are completely barren, although house valuable minerals
which make the system a large trading place. The other three planets are gas
giants and have not been surface inspected yet.
