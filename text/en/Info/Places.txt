A planetary system ~5.2 parsecs away from Earth that houses several
planets with sentient life on them. Found approximately 700 years ago
now, this is the second system reached by humans, and the first with
sentient life.

When the system was found, rejoice was had throughout all mankind,
finally knowing that they weren't alone in the universe.

Then, of course, the expeditioners began to attack. But, those are
fine details.

Algidistari is a planetary system ~13.8 parsecs in distance from
Earth. While it has many planets in its main sequence, and many rocks,
it is for the most part not suitable for human life due to its cold
atmosphere caused by a small central star.

Several of the planets in this system such as Neptune 1135872 are
quite large and are semi-habitable, thus becoming quite suitable for
magi of the \chCaeruleum\c- mode to test magic on.

A planet in the Aëtos-Vi planetary system composed of four land masses
and a large amount of water, populated by a highly intelligent
light-manipulating species known as the Kiryy.

Previously, humans also lived on this planet, but were driven out by a
large-scale terrorist attack.

Ch'ari is generally dull and dark-grey looking save for the water, but
the communications of the Kiryy light up the darkness in a beautiful
fashion.

Its inhabitants include fish and plant life, as well as land-dwelling
beasts such as giant mammoth-like creatures and the two-legged Falx.

A planet in the Aëtos-Vi planetary system whose dominant species is a
humanoid avian creature, the "Peristera" (pl. "Peristeres") or,
colloquially, "Perist".

When humans arrived on Durla Prime, the Peristeres were highly
frightened by the presence of an alien, sentient being, and war broke
loose as soon as they began to fly away. Refusing to attack, the
Peristeres ended the war a mere month later, after learning to
communicate with the primate species.

The planet is extremely similar to Earth, even having grass and trees
that mostly resemble their earthly counterparts.

The year is 1649 New Era. After an event that almost led to an
apocalypse in 3031 CE, humanity collectively decided to mark a new era
dedicated to progressing travel and communications across the galaxy.

By 1000 NE, most of the population on Earth had moved to other
inhabitable planets, but still a large population remains on the blue
planet.

Earth, and moreover humanity, has remained largely the same as it was
in the middle of the Common Era, although around 300 years of history
were lost in the calamity.

Whether the Hell found ripping into our dimension is actually from any

inhabitants seek to destroy and enslave everything they can get their
hands on.

Composed of several ranks, Hell is a dictatorship led by one called
the Icon of Sin, or Satan by some. The inhabitants of Hell seem to
gain some kind of dark energy from suffering and death, possibly an
abstract power like that previously found on Earth, thousands of years
ago.

In 2714 CE, a huge interplanetary workload boom began, spawning
numerous factories and artificial workplaces on Mars manned by robots.

Thanks to advances in terrestrial travel, the ability to transfer
goods between Mars and Earth became cheap enough to be profitable
during the periods where Mars is closer to Earth.

Still to this day many companies on Earth—and even some intra-galactic
corporations like OFMD—use Mars as a place to house autonomous work.

in this dimension are made of pure, primordial magic of which is
untouchable by almost any outside source; hence the name, a caged
dimension for only the Gods to roam.

Hermes is the only known God capable of manifesting their physical

outside communication. His demise during the events of the calamity
have halted all further knowledge about the dimension, leaving it
merely the mental shape of a huge chrome cylinder box.

Most things about this hyperdimension are unknown as of yet. When the
God Thoth descended to the mortal realm in 1344 NE, the body she chose
told stories of living in this dimension before becoming an immortal
holy vessel.

Before this event, the dimension was unheard of, with no leaps
occurring between it and this realm. Since Thoth left this plane,
nothing more has been found, leading to lots of speculation and
questioning of whether this place truly exists. Nevertheless, many
years later, artifacts began to surface.

The origin of its name is unknown, and many details of its appearance
were left vague by the legendary vessel, making consensus difficult on
its description. The only consistent line through all of her stories
is a sense of emptiness.

Three of the planets, Eta, Ni and Keta, are desert planets capable of

Seven of the planets are completely barren, although house valuable
minerals which make the system a large trading hub. The remaining
four planets are gas giants and have not been surface inspected yet.
