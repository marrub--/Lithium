A planetary system ~5.2 parsecs away from Earth that houses several
planets with sentient life on them. Found approximately 700 years ago
now, this is the second system reached by humans, and the first with
sentient life.

When the system was found, rejoice was had throughout all mankind,
finally knowing that they weren't alone in the universe.

Then, of course, the expeditioners began to attack. But, those are
fine details.

Algidistari is a planetary system ~13.8 parsecs in distance from
Earth. While it has many planets in its main sequence, and many rocks,
it is for the most part not suitable for human life due to its cold
atmosphere caused by a small central star.

Several of the planets in this system such as Neptune 1135872 are
quite large and are semi-habitable, thus becoming quite suitable for
magi of the \chCaeruleum\c- mode to test magic on.

A planet in the Aëtos-Vi planetary system composed of four land masses
and a large amount of water, populated by a highly intelligent
light-manipulating species known as the Kiryy.

Previously, humans also lived on this planet, but were driven out by a
large-scale terrorist attack.

Ch'ari is generally dull and dark-grey looking save for the water, but
the communications of the Kiryy light up the darkness in a beautiful
fashion.

Its inhabitants include fish and plant life, as well as land-dwelling
beasts such as giant mammoth-like creatures and the two-legged Falx.

A planet in the Aëtos-Vi planetary system whose dominant species is a
humanoid avian creature, the "Peristera" (pl. "Peristeres") or,
colloquially, "Perist".

When humans arrived on Durla Prime, the Peristeres were highly
frightened by the presence of an alien, sentient being, and war broke
loose as soon as they began to fly away. Refusing to attack, the
Peristeres ended the war a mere month later, after learning to
communicate with the primate species.

The planet is extremely similar to Earth, even having grass and trees
that mostly resemble their earthly counterparts.

Whether the Hell found ripping into our dimension is actually from any

inhabitants seek to destroy and enslave everything they can get their

Composed of several ranks, Hell is a dictatorship led by one called
the Icon of Sin, or Satan by some. The inhabitants of Hell seem to
gain some kind of dark energy from suffering and death, possibly an
abstract power like that previously found on Earth, thousands of years
ago.

In 2714 CE, a huge interplanetary workload boom began, spawning
numerous factories and artificial workplaces on Mars manned by robots.

Thanks to advances in terrestrial travel, the ability to transfer
goods between Mars and Earth became cheap enough to be profitable
during the periods where Mars is closer to Earth.

Still to this day many companies on Earth—and even some intra-galactic
corporations like OFMD—use Mars as a place to house autonomous work.

Most things about this hyperdimension are unknown as of yet. When the

told stories of living in this dimension before becoming an immortal

Before this event, the dimension was unheard of, with no leaps
occurring between it and this realm. Since Thoth left this plane,
nothing more has been found, leading to lots of speculation and
questioning of whether this place truly exists. Nevertheless, many
years later, artifacts began to surface.

The origin of its name is unknown, and many details of its appearance
were left vague by the legendary vessel, making consensus difficult on
its description. The only consistent line through all of her stories
is a sense of emptiness.
