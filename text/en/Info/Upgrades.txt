This is a military type Heads Up Display program, which tracks vital
signs, munitions, armor status, and more with simple numeric
signifiers and symbols.

Originally designed by a former video game designer, a great amount of
effort had to be put into fine-tuning this program to tell you exactly
when you're about to die, your armor is about to break and get you
killed, or you're about to run out of ammunition, and then die.

Developed by Baobab III of the planet Durla Prime and manufactured at

damage of one type almost completely for an indefinite amount of time.

This plating uses a set of unique systems that can each block one kind
of attack with extreme prejudice, but due to allowing full control of
the plating to each system, can only use one at a time.

Works over your currently equipped armor, so damage from even rockets
may be lowered into what feels like a small tickle.
