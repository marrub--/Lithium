%% LITHEND_Normal_1_Ari
Waves of light scatter and permeate,
during these last few moments
before death sweeps and parts us,

at least hold my hand.

Yet, at the same time,
something nags at the back of your mind.
Like a truck, the wave crashes into you.

One last silent hit,
and you've left this place.

The only thing left is yourself.


No more.


You can't hold on to pretty pictures.

@@ LITHEND_Normal_2_Ari
\cnYou come to. All you can see are rolling plains. Golden grass. The
sight of it makes you feel something strange. And in the distance, you
see your home city.
@@

\caIt's burning.
\caWas this the result of your stunt?
\caDid you... cause this?

@@
\cnYou look up to the sky. Cruisers bearing the mark of the moon.

\caNo, the war had already begun long ago. It only looked like it was
over. This is the end.

\cnThis is the end. You hold your gun.

\caIn your mind, your sister sighs.

%% LITHEND_Normal_3_Ari
\caA body in the depths of your memory.
\caYou feel like the world wasn't meant
\cafor you both to live in.

\cnSecondarily, a fabrication of self,
\cnsheared through exosymbol.

\ckA broken world, or faulty individuals?
\ciSomething more, a repartée of death—
\cga sickness of the heart, everywhere.

\cxA hope to regain what was taken.
\cxA hope to see closure.
\cyHopes turn into dreams.
\cyDreams turn into reality.
\ctAnother time awaits.

\cwThe story of the two tied at rebirth,
\cdhas yet once more closed.
