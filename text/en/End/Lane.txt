I feel trapped in this place,
this corner, this room,
I have no one, that's okay.


It always seems like the end.
It's just seeing the ocean.
Tears flow, clouds part.


The fundament gets laid bare,
eroded by salt and ash,
the clouds part.


It feels like nothing's changed.
Those moods still take you,
all the time.

Space always contained you, people always caged you. A little more
time staying in the cage and it would've been the end. Would it? Why
do you even think of these things?

You remember the past, but you can't keep letting it hurt you. Still,
yet, it feels impossible to let go of memories. Let go? Try to forget?
Just try to live with it? What's the matter? What was the right way
out? Your head is spinning as you run through this labyrinth.

Cigarette smoke fills the room. The smell of alcohol invades your mind
as a clear liquid rolls in from below the door.

War.

A voice in your head gets louder.
You're sitting in the corner of a room meant for bad people.
\cw  I can't keep getting up in the morning.
\cu       No problem.
\cw  I can't keep taxing myself like this, like everyone needs of me.
\cu       No problem.
\cw  I don't understand why I keep going.
\cu       No problem.
\c-With an ocean of depressive thoughts, you considered all paths forward.
\cu       Suicide would be a lot easier.
\cw  Animals are the same. Like this, they choose the same path.
\cu       End it.
\cw  Would anyone care?
\cu       No.
\cw  Then that's the right way out.
\cw  Suicide would be a lot easier.

You awaken in a hospital bed, cybernetics turned off, body aching
all over. You won.

Moonlight seeps into your retinas. You can't see the scars on your
arms like this. Everything is quiet. For once, you slept well.

For a moment, you thought you needed a voice in your head to tell
yourself it'll be alright. The delusion fades away. The voice telling
you to kill yourself is quiet. You don't say it to yourself.

You wait a minute. You just lie there.

Nothing else happens.

Your muscles relax.

For now, you've won.

\cdYou awaken in a hospital bed. It's day.

\cnA man is sitting next to you, and he gives you a total for your
payment. It's too much for you to fathom. You end up settling down in
a nice house in a big city, living the high life.

\cyThe effort you went through almost seems worth it now, but still in
your mind lingers memories of horrors no one should know.

\ckIn the end, the corporation you worked with merged with a new
company, the UAC, and you never heard from them again.

\cgIf what you saw was real...
\cg...maybe it's best nobody knows you're a hero.
