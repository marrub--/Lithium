@@ LITHEND_Normal_1_Jem
In the beginning, you felt comfort. Comfort of yourself and your home.
The allowances of personal will; But so soon was it ripped away, your
life in twain.

At age 12, A.O.F attacked Delsona. Killed, destroyed, and enslaved all
of the inhabitants. You. Your parents. Everyone.
@@

That sanctity you felt so long ago must have just been a facade,
so incredibly thin,
the world unable to hold you.

@@
A.O.F took so much from you, even your identity. Unlike other trans
people, they couldn't give you another name. Jeremy was always your
name.

This was the only mercy given.

@@ LITHEND_Normal_2_Jem
But along the way, as you suffered your entombment, you learned that
you were not alone.

Zeke was the first to approach you. Ready to die, he pleaded to you
for the mercy of death. He knew quite well you couldn't. Your
compassion for him knew no bounds, with no way to express it.

He introduced you to another friend, Daniel. She was radiant with
love, like you. Even though they were both able to tell you names they
prefered, they weren't allowed to use them. Nor were you.

The two had more in mind than just being friends with you, though.

In a matter of weeks, the Deceiver movement began.

@@ LITHEND_Normal_3_Jem
Michael taught the seven of you how to fight back. Not with weapons,
but with code. Zeke spearheaded the firmware hacks.
@@

Even if you could not see yourself,
you were alive, together.

@@
And in the time it took for you to come to terms with yourself,

so did the others.

Samuel and Josh vowed not only to destroy A.O.F, but to be together for
the rest of their days after this was over.

Solomon wanted nothing but repentance. It took a lot to get here, and
a lot of sacrifice of others.

@@ LITHEND_Normal_4_Jem
Zeke wanted nothing more but to live. Finally, he had accepted life
over death.

Michael knew he could help others just like he had here, and vowed to
commit his life to doing so.

Daniel wanted to live with you, and to become your partner. She had
never met someone like her before, much less someone from a place as
accepting as Delsona.

The amount of fluid coming out of your face is greater than the amount
of fluid that has come out of your body since you were enslaved a
millionfold. You finish crying.

@@ LITHEND_Normal_5_Jem
It's over, and you can feel your senses coming back to you. You think
to yourself, for once. But only sad thoughts come—What happened to the
others? Will I ever know?

Perhaps some truths are better left unknown.

You look around you. You see a familiar scene. A terrifying one. Yet,
a happy one. You are in your home town. Burned down and barren, but
still exactly as it was so many decades ago.

Nobody is here.

Yet, you feel their spirits. You feel the pulse of the planet coursing
throughout your body once more. The feeling of true freedom. The
freedom of movement, and to be what you wish.

@@ LITHEND_Normal_6_Jem
\cdAnd so, you are at last free. Free again to think and observe, and
see for yourself the abolishment of your captors.

\cnNo more distrust of your will. For this sake, this is only the
beginning.
@@

\ctBut for the ones you replaced,
\ct  the ones you mourn,  and for yourself,

\crthis is merely an end.

@@
\czPerhaps one day you will forgive yourself for what you have
sacrificed, but today that is no matter.
@@

\cvToday is the beginning. The beginning of life once again.
\cvYour parents are waiting back at home.

\cxIt's time to go back.
