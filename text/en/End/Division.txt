%% \#dlg_ending_DivisionSigil
\cgYou have made



       a dire




          mistake.


 I will not




forgive you



nor will you



be forgiven

%% \#BOSS_DIV_1
Wait.

You must leave this place.

%% \#BOSS_DIV_2
I cannot let you have it.

If you acquire it, everything will go to waste.

%% \#BOSS_DIV_3
I know you have defeated me once before.

Time has repeated.

%% \#BOSS_DIV_4
You must leave, now.

%% \#BOSS_DIV_5
If time is allowed to repeat once more the Artifact may not be in my hands.

I do not know if any others would know how to handle it.

%% \#BOSS_DIV_6
I do not know if I can.

Leave. Now.

%% \#BOSS_DIV_7
If you are so avaritious that you must truly defeat me once more,

do not touch the Artifact.

%% \#BOSS_DIV_8
Kill me if you must.

But I will not hold back.

I plead of you to leave,

or die by my hand.

%% \#VERSE_CORRUPTED
[the archdemon thrashes / i prepare the ritual]

"You never get a break from life. Not until you die."

"Have you ever died? Really, and truly?"

"Are you ready to find out what it feels like?"

[the archdemon protests]

"It won't hurt. But you will feel every part of it."
