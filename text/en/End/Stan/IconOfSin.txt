It feels like nothing's changed.


Those moods still take you.


All the time.

You hoped one day you would be happy. That day never came. It's just a
fantasy at this point. A fantasy in the sea of a dream.

                       "Why am I like this?"


I don't know.


                     "Will I ever be saved?"


Again, all you can bring yourself to answer,

With an ocean of depressive thoughts, you considered all alternatives.

      No, they wouldn't.




                  "...Did anyone care in the first place?"




              No,

"Please..."




             Drowning in the middle of a miserable dream,

It's all you can think about. The need to get away from this life.
From this accursed world. Nothing is worth it. No matter how hard you
try in life,

            you are simply ignored.






End it.

\cdYou awaken in a hospital bed, cybernetics turned off,
\cdbody aching all over. It's over. The fight against
\cdHell has been won.

\cnA man is sitting next to you, and he gives you a total
\cnfor your payment. It's too much for you to fathom. You
\cnend up settling down in a nice house in a big city,
\cnliving the high life.

\cyThe effort you went through almost seems worth it now,
\cybut still in your mind lingers memories of
\cyhorrors no man should know.

\ckIn the end, the corporation you worked with
\ckmerged with a new company, the UAC, and
\ckyou never heard from them again.

\cgIf what you saw was real...
\cg...maybe it's best nobody knows you're a hero.
