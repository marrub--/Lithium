   "So, running our own code is too risky, as you know. The ASIC would catch it right away. But what we can do is get the kernel to execute code for us, specifically when it's already in ring 0. Well, you may have noticed Solomon's name in the mission parameters looked a bit off. Since he was the instructor, we set his name to overflow a certain buffer during a kernel call, straight into a function pointer. Just point that right next to the fixed address, and bam. Kiloword boundaries give us plenty of space to write a self-modifying program in that padding space.\n"

(Sorry they don't look so great, the raw optic nerve image format is rather large.)

From there it'll embed itself into the ROM and your mind will have fully returned to you by the end of the day.\n"
   "\n"
   "Now, what it can't do: Get rid of the ASIC chip. You will have to be careful not to trip it, but for the most part, it just doesn't have permissions to track anything we're doing. You should be able to mitigate it in a few ways since this program removes all of the hooks in the kernel that call into it, but you'll have to do them yourself. I'm sure you can. Good luck. Zeke.";
